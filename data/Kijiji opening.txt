Hi, my name is Josh, 22, and I'm a 4th year student in Economics uOttawa. 
I'm interested in the room at the current price you are offering it and am willing to sign. My main concern is the people currently living there. I'm a mature student looking for a quiet comfortable house to finish out my studies strong and do not wish for too many social gatherings or parties (at all). If everyone in the house has the same academic goals which align with my own, please let me know as soon as possible. I'm actally quite a chill and timid person. https://www.facebook.com/JoshKouTwo/
